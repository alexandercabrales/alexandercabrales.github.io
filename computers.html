	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>
	-My most recent project involved fixing my Gateway DX4860 desktop. I bought the PC from a friend roughly three years ago as an upgrade. Initially, the PC was
	nearly unusable. A lot of viruses on the machine made using the internet and Microsoft Office nearly impossible. Luckily at the time I had a laptop to do any school
	work, so I mostly used the Gateway to game. Now I wasn't too key on computer maintainence at this time, so instead of reformatting the system I decided to upgrade 
	the hardware with a new power supply (500W), an AMD video card, and a fan for the video card to have a better gaming experience. I took my PC to a computer repair shop
	and had them upgrade my pc with all the new hardware and new AMD drivers needed to run the PC. The upgrade did work and my gaming experience was much better, but 
	eventually the video card (being at least 5 years old) died, and the video would not load on to the monitor. At this time, I didn't know enough about computers to even
	know that this was the problem, so I left this computer in a corner of my room to collect dust. The PC sat broken in my room for nearly 2 years before I thought of trying 
	to fix it on my own after learning a lot more about computers. I first tried a new monitor with no luck. Then I tried using a different cable for the video instead of HDMI with no luck.
	After realizing it wasn't an issue with the video cables or monitor, I checked the RAM to see if any were loose. None were loose, so I tried taking the RAM out and putting it back in again to see, 
	but I had no luck when turning on the PC. So, at this point, I didn't know if the RAM was good, or if the motherboard was fried. I knew that the power supply was good because I had replaced it by upgrading.
	I needed answers so I used the internet to try to find answers. After reading a bit about possible problems with the issue, I came
	to the conclusion that the problem was either with the motherboard or with the video card. I took out the video card and booted the default video from the motherboard, and I was finally greeted with a video on my monitor. Success. 
  	I powered down the computer, cleaned out the pc thoroughly, powered the pc back on, back-up files I wanted onto a seperate drive, and I began the reformatting process for the Gateway. It took some time, but eventually
	I reformatted to the default settings, made the necessary backup discs and restore point, and I added Webroot anti-virus and internet security to protect the PC before powering down and calling it a job well done. <br>
	</br>
	-For my next project I want to build a personal computer from scratch and I want to use the Linux operating system (OS). Lately, I've messing around with different Linux operating systems, trying out a different OS
	than Microsoft. I've installed and used the TailsOS Linux on my old Gateway and HP Pavilion, but I want to try Ubuntu out. I've messed around with Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine, but I want to use it as my main OS in the future. 
	I still have some time for this project, as I'm still researching parts that are compatible with Linux and aren't too much money.
