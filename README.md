Hi, how are you? My name is Alexander Cabrales. 

Any questions, advice, and criticisms are all welcome: alexcabrales@rocketmail.com

Update: Yes, I do use AI in my coding. However, much of my code is built up by me first before I even get AI involved. AI is a tool that when used improperly will produce AI slop; however, if you used in the right hands and mind, can really accomplish a lot of real great work.
