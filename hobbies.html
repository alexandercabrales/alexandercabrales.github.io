      <h1>Sports and E-Sports</h1>
      <p>
        - I've always had a passion for sports at a young age, playing soccer, baseball, and tennis.<br>
        - I ended up playing tennis in high school and also began to play the e-sport Counter Strike.<br>
        - I play tennis and Counter Strike still and enjoy watching soccer, football and baseball on TV.
      </p>

      <h1>Reading and Writing</h1>
      <p>
        - I love to read and write every day, and I write fiction and poems in my spare time.<br>
        - Some of my favorite authors are John Steinbeck, Hunter S. Thompson, Edgar Allan Poe, and Kurt Vonnegut.
      </p>

      <h1>Computers</h1>
      <p>
        - I've been using computers for most of my life, learning the basics in my teens, such as typing and the components that make up a computer.<br>
        - I hold an A.S. in IT from Ohlone College, which has given me a better understanding of computers, networking, and programming.
