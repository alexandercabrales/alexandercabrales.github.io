	<h1>Sports and E-Sports</h1>
	
	<p>-I've always had a passion for sports at a young age, playing soccer, baseball, and tennis. <br>
	</br>-I ended up playing tennis in high school and also began to play the e-sport Counter Strike. <br>
	</br>-I play tennis and Counter Strike still and enjoy watching soccer, football and baseball on T.V.</p>
	<h1>Reading and Writing</h1>
	<p>-I love to read and write everyday, and I write fiction and poems in my spare time.<br>
	</br>-Some of my favorite authors are John Steinbeck, Hunter S. Thompson, Edgar Allen Poe, and Kurt Vonnegut.<br>
	</br></p>
	<h1>Computers</h1>
	<p>-I've been using computers for most of my life, learning the basics in my teens, such as typing and the components that make up a computer.<br>
</br> 	   -I hold an A.S. in IT from Ohlone College, which has given me a better understanding of computers, networking, and programming.<br>
