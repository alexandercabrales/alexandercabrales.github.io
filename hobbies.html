	<h1>Sports and e-sports</h1>
	
	<p>-I've always had a passion for sports at a young age, playing soccer, baseball, and tennis. <br>
	</br>-I ended up playing tennis in high school and also began to play the e-sport Counter Strike. <br>
	</br>-I play tennis and Counter Strike still and enjoy watching soccer, football and baseball on T.V.</p>
	<h1>Reading and Writing</h1>
	<p>-I love to read and write everyday, and I write fiction and poems in my spare time.<br>
	</br>-Some of my favorite authors are John Steinbeck, Hunter S. Thompson, Edgar Allen Poe, and Kurt Vonnegut.<br>
	</br>-I'm in the process of starting my own tutoring business and editing business: Cabrales Critque</p>
	<h1>Computers</h1>
	<p>-I've been using computers for most of my life, learning the basics in my teens, such as typing and the components that make up a computer.<br>
	</br>-After high school I shyed away from learning more about computers and decided to invest my time into becoming a police officer, serving the community for the greater good.<br>
	</br>-However, the more I learned about America's awful Criminal Justice system, the more I started to realize that I, due to a number of reasons, couldn't become a police officer.<br>
	</br>-Instead of switching degrees my senior year of college I decided to finish my degree and keep working to pay of my school debt.<br>
	</br>-After a year and a half of work I finished paying of my school debt, saved up some money, quit my job, and, with some help from my amazing family, I went back to school for computers (a secret passion of mine).<br>
	</br>-Currently, I'm learning programming in a variety of languages, building personal websites for myself and family, and looking to start a career in the IT field.
