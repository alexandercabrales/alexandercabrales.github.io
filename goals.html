<h1>Personal Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>
My most important personal goal at the moment is trying to make a brand and start a business with English tutoring. 
I'm training to become a better tutor at Ohlone College while building my brand and business of Cabrales Critique.
Currently, I have a website, logo, flyers, a business card, and pricing for services. However, more time is needed
in creating a better business model and possibly asking my brother (who is a English/History Teacher) to be my business partner. 
</li>
<li>
I personally have a fitness goal of getting a six pack. I started lifting after high school when I weighed 155 pounds and was quite skinny. However, 
through hard work and a lot of eating, I've gained a total of 30 pounds of fat and muscle, which has definitely boosted my confidence. Although I'm more fit now, 
I still want washboard abs, which I know I can achieve. I go to the gym two to three times a week, but I know that I need to hit the gym at least four times a week, and I need to change my diet a bit to reach this goal. 
</li>
<li>
Another personal goal of mine is to become a published author. I've always loved reading and writing. This love for literature has 
 inspired me to write some poems and short stories in the past and even take a couple fiction workshops in college with some talented authors.
 (Shoutout to Carmen Madden and Steve Guitierrez for reading my work and offering great feedback. Thank you. Steve, I feel like selling
 bagels, but now I know I can write I just need to sit down and do it. Also, thanks for sending me your first book for free!) I keep my poems 
 archived online through a personal blog on Tumblr. I would describe my writing as rough, raw, and quite emotional. It is definitely not for the faint heart.
 I think in order to achieve this goal I need to sit down everyday and write more, and I need not be afraid of what people think of my work. 
 </li>
 </ul>
 <h1>Current Career Goal</h1>
 <ul>
 <p>
 My most important career goal at the moment is getting an entry-level job in the Information Technologies sector. As I've said before, I intially went to school to study
 our Criminal Justice system in order to become a police officer. However, after learning a lot about this system and the monster it has become I knew that 
 I could not become a police officer. Ethically, yes, I could become a police officer but, morally, no, I could not start a career in law enforcement. Yet, instead of
switching majors so close to a degree, I decided to finish my Bachelors. From here my next task was to pay off debt from school loans by working. After paying off the loans
I was faced with a decision: keep working at In-N-Out and look long-term with working to get my own store, or save up some money, quit the job, and go back to school full-time.
After thinking for about a month I came to the decision that I was missing something at In-N-Out and I didn't have a passion for the business, so I put in my two weeks, left on good terms,
and I enrolled for Spring 2017 term at Ohlone College for Computer Science. However, after a rough semester, with a W for a late start Trigonometry class and a realization that 
my arithemetic and problem solving skills were lacking in the Math department. I thought I could cram Math to learn it faster for my Trigonometry and object-oriented programming class for Fall 2017.
But I realized after the first day of the object-oriented programming that I didn't need to rush the process and that I need to take it a little slower or else I'm going to fail. 
So, I retook the Trigonometry class again, dropped the object-oriented programming class, added a computer introduction class, and got a job as a English tutor at Ohlone, which
led me to being exposed to Python, 3D-printing, HTML, CSS, and the power of computers in our society (economically and technologically);also, I've been able to pursue my 
passion with helping others and English into an achievement with a CRLA certification and the building of Cabrales Critique (still being worked on). Now I feel that I'm on the cusp
of a long and fullfiling IT career with a entry-level IT job. I feel that I have the skills and knowledge necessary to sort IT problems, assess obstacles, plan solutions and standards,
and then look to sustain said solutions and standards. I'm currently getting my A.S. in Information Technologies with an Emphasis in Databases this Fall 2018, and I'm currently seeking any entry-level
IT positions in which the company feels that I will be an asset to their organization and the company feels that I bring a passion for Information Technologies.
</p>
<h1>Future Career Goal
<li>After achieving this career goal I would say that the next step in my career would be to work to hard, learn the ropes of the industry and company, and look to grow at a pace that isn't too fast
but not too slow either; ultimately I want to achieve a B.S. in Business Adminstration with an Emphasis on Information Technology Management. I feel that this education would help my
IT career and company immensely, allowing me to grow even more.
