<h1>Personal Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>
I want to learn to solder.

I personally have a fitness goal of getting a six pack. I started lifting after high school when I weighed 155 pounds and was quite skinny. However, 
through hard work and a lot of eating, I've gained a total of 30 pounds of fat and muscle, which has definitely boosted my confidence. Lately, due to the lockdowns
I've gotten more fat and loss a good amount of muscle. So, for the time being, the fitness goal is losing weight and regaining muscle I've loss. 
</li>
 </ul>
 <h1>Current Career Goal</h1>
 <ul>
 <p>
I want to build my work experience in law.
