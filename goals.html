<h1>Personal Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>
I want to learn to solder.

I personally have a fitness goal of getting a six pack. I started lifting after high school when I weighed 155 pounds and was quite skinny. However, 
through hard work and a lot of eating, I've gained a total of 30 pounds of fat and muscle, which has definitely boosted my confidence. Although I'm more fit now, 
I still want washboard abs, which I know I can achieve. Lately, I've been slacking on the gym, but I'm slowly building motivation back. 
</li>

Another personal goal of mine is to become a published author. I've always loved reading and writing. This love for literature has 
 inspired me to write some poems and short stories in the past and even take a couple fiction workshops in college with some talented authors.
 (Shoutout to Carmen Madden and Steve Guitierrez for reading my work and offering great feedback. Thank you. Steve, I feel like selling
 bagels, but now I know I can write I just need to sit down and do it. Also, thanks for sending me your first book for free!) I keep my poems 
 archived online through a personal blog on Tumblr. I would describe my writing as rough, raw, and quite emotional. It is definitely not for the faint heart.
 I think in order to achieve this goal I need to sit down everyday and write more, and I need not be afraid of what people think of my work.
