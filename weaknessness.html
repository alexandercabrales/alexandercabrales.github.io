      <p>
        I'm not an expert in Computers or IT yet, but I continue to learn new technologies to grow my skills.<br><br>
        My Spanish isn't perfect, but I can understand most conversations and communicate well. I'm practicing every day to improve.<br><br>
        My math skills are currently limited. I haven’t taken a college-level math course yet, but I’m actively working on arithmetic, problem-solving, and algebra.<br><br>
        My programming knowledge is not the best. I’ve created projects in C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, but I’m not yet at a senior developer level. I’m committed to learning more through future projects.<br><br>
        I've quite a reserved person and keep mostly quiet, but that doesn't mean I can't communicate effectively.<br><br>
        Although I have a great smile, I’m very camera shy — which is why you won’t find many photos of me online. I value my privacy.
