	<h1>Weaknesses</h1>
	
	<p>I'm not an expert in Computers or IT, yet, but I plan to work on becoming one in both. <br>
	</br>My Spanish isn't perfect, but I can understand what Spanish speakers are saying most of the time, and I can hold conversations well. I'm practicing every day to get better and better.<br>
	</br>My math is lacking a little bit. I've yet to take a college level Math course, but I'm working on my arithmetic, problem solving and alegabra skills currently. In the future, I plan on taking and learning Precalculus and Calculus <br>
	</br>My programming knowledge is very basic. I have some program projects in C++ and Python, but I'm nowhere near the level of a junior developer. However, I plan on focusing on Python solely to progress in programming. <br>
	</br>Although I have a great smile, I'm very camera shy when it comes to pictures, which is why I don't have many pictures of myself online. I enjoy my privacy.
